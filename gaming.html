<h1>Gaming Info</h1>
<p>Gaming can be great fun! Or it can be totally serious. Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
<p>So I've put together a list of my top tips for great gamers</p>
<h2>Make a to-do list</h2>
<p>A <strong>game  to-do list</strong> is a list of what you want to do in a game.</p>
<p>For example: Minecraft</p>
<p>In Minecraft, you always will come to a point were you will say"What will I do next?"</p>
<p>So this is why you should do a to-do list</p>
<h2>Don't forget your michrophone!</h2>
<p>If you are a quiet talker then it would be better if you have a michrophone.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons of why you should always have a michrophone:</p>
<ul>

    <ul>
        <p><li>For your viewers to hear you loud and clear.</li></p>
        <p><li>So if you are shy it will sound like you were never shy.</li></p>
    </ul>

<h2>Plan were your Studio/Office will be</h2>
<p>When you are filming it is always better if you film in a studio or office</p>
<p>You should also plan which room will be your office or studio.</p>
<p>If it is a Studio then I think the best room is the biggest room</p>
<p>If it is a Office then I think the best room is at least the 2nd biggest or 3rd</p>
<h2>Know when you are on</h2>
<p>When you are going to film a video you should plan when you want to start the video.</p>
<p>For me that is a really good idea. And I think everyone agrees, right?</p>
<p class="top-tip"> If you keep losing when you are fighting a boss, don't give up - think of a plan to defeat the boss!!!</p>
</ul>
